# alx-backend-storage

This repository contains projects and exercises focused on back-end storage solutions, including databases (SQL and NoSQL) and caching mechanisms. It covers a range of topics from basic database interactions to more advanced concepts like data modeling, indexing, and optimization.

## Projects

The repository is organized into several projects, each exploring a specific storage technology or concept:

* **0x00-MySQL_Advanced:** This project delves into advanced MySQL concepts, covering topics such as:
    * Subqueries
    * Triggers
    * Stored procedures
    * Views
    * Functions
    * Transactions
    * Indexes
* **0x01-NoSQL:** This project explores NoSQL databases, specifically MongoDB, and includes tasks on:
    * Basic CRUD operations
    * Data modeling
    * Indexing
    * Aggregation framework
    * Data visualization
* **0x02-redis_basic:** This project introduces Redis, an in-memory data structure store, and covers:
    * Basic Redis commands
    * Data types (strings, lists, sets, hashes)
    * Pub/Sub messaging
    * Caching

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository utilize the following technologies:

* **MySQL:** A popular open-source relational database management system.
* **MongoDB:** A leading NoSQL document database.
* **Redis:** An in-memory data structure store often used for caching and real-time data processing.
* **Python:** A versatile programming language used for interacting with databases and implementing storage solutions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the projects in this repository, you will:

* Gain a deeper understanding of different storage solutions and their use cases.
* Learn how to interact with databases using SQL and NoSQL paradigms.
* Develop skills in data modeling, indexing, and query optimization.
