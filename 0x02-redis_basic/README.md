# 0x02-redis_basic

This project introduces Redis, an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. It covers basic commands, data types, and common use cases like caching and pub/sub messaging.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

* Understand the benefits and use cases of Redis.
* Install and configure Redis.
* Interact with Redis using the command-line interface.
* Perform basic operations (CRUD) on different data types in Redis.
* Implement caching mechanisms using Redis.
* Utilize Redis for pub/sub messaging.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a series of tasks, each focusing on a specific concept or technique:

* **0-main.py:** Basic interaction with Redis using Python.
* **1-main.py:** Uses Redis to store and retrieve a string value.
* **2-main.py:** Stores a list of values in Redis.
* **3-main.py:** Stores a dictionary of values in Redis.
* **4-main.py:** Counts how many times a specific key has been accessed.
* **5-main.py:** Implements an expiring web cache and tracker.
* **6-main.py:** Implements a replay function for cached web pages.
* **7-main.py:** Creates a decorator to track function calls.
* **8-main.py:** Implements a cache with a limited size.
* **9-main.py:** Implements a LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.
* **100-main.py:** Implements a basic rate limiter.

## Technologies Used

* Redis
* Python with redis-py library
