# 0x01-NoSQL

This project delves into the world of NoSQL databases, specifically focusing on MongoDB. It covers various aspects, from basic CRUD operations and data modeling to more advanced concepts like aggregation, indexing, and data visualization.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

* Understand the distinctions between SQL and NoSQL databases.
* Explain the different types of NoSQL databases.
* Install and configure MongoDB.
* Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on MongoDB documents.
* Model various data scenarios using MongoDB.
* Use MongoDB shell and Compass to interact with the database.
* Implement indexing strategies to optimize query performance.
* Utilize aggregation pipelines for data processing and analysis.
* Visualize MongoDB data using MongoDB Charts.
